This is a game I have been working on in my free time for quite a while now. It is built in Java using a library called LWJGL, the same API used by games such as Minecraft and Project Zomboid. The entire game is built from scratch in a custom engine,
including the graphics pipeline. The game itself, while still early in development, already includes many features I am quite proud of, including:
<li>A fully functional saving and loading system that uses GSON and ZSTD to efficiently serialize and store the game world.</li>
<li>A procedurally generated infinite world created using Perlin Noise.</li>
<li>A sandbox environment where players can freely place and destroy various tiles and entities.</li>
<li>A crafting system, complete with tool requirements for certain recipes.</li>
<li>A tile rendering system that utilizes autotiling and texture splatting to create smooth and immersive terrain.</li>
<li>A full array of user settings, including localization.</li>
<li>3D audio effects powered by OpenAL and STB Vorbis.</li>
<br>
Everything within the game outside of the libraries and audio effects was made by me, including the sprites. I am very proud of what I have accomplished with this project, and intend to continue working on it.
